# Mini-Project: Combo-Finder

The Combo-Finder mini-project is a Python-based utility designed to efficiently identify combinations of products that, together, fall within a specified price range. This tool is particularly useful for budget planning, promotional bundling, or any scenario where grouping items by total cost is necessary. Utilizing a random sampling method, the script explores various combinations from a product list until it finds a predetermined number of combinations that meet the budget criteria.
